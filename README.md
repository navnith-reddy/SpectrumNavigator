# Spectrum Navigator

Spectrum Navigator is a spectrum data management tool developed for the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA). Spectrum Navigator provides a holdings summary in the form a csv file and shapefile for a given client number(s). Spectrum Navigator is also capable of retrieving information from the ACMA's Register of Radiocommunication Licences (RRL) and Australian Spectrum Map Grid (ASMG) to build a queryable geodatabase which facilitates the production of client shape files, kml files and data extracts.

Spectrum Navigator is accompanied by two spectrum management libraries that provide extended functionality such as unique Hierarchial Cell Identifier Scheme (HCIS) sequence detection, HCIS to shapefile conversion, build and compilation of primary ASMG and RRL files and automated database retrieval.
