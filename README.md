# Spectrum NAVigator

The ACMA recently re-allocated spectrum in the 3.4 GHz and 3.7 GHz bands for issue of spectrum licences in defined areas. The ACMA plans to auction licences in Q3 2023. The new licences will complement existing spectrum licences issued in the 3400-3800 MHz band in defined areas. The process of spectrum re-allocation requires an assessment of whether or not to impose competition limits. In order to develop competition limits, it is important to understand how much spectrum is owned by incumbent licencees.

Spectrum Navigator is an ACMA tool that searches the daily extract of the ACMA Register of Radiocommunication Licences for spectrum licence holdings of a given licencee. Spectrum Navigator takes multiple client numbers and determines the area and the amount of spectrum held along with other licence data.

> WORK IN PROGRESS: Using RRL composite dataset, Spectrum Navigator will generate .shp and .kml files with attribute tables for each given licence.
